This program is a lexical and syntax analyzer for the language described by its grammar in 'grammar.txt'.

The error detection works as expected for all the cases provided in 'source1.pas' through 'source15.pas', 
	'lexical_identifier_error.pas', and 'lexical_integer_error.pas', BUT it is far from comprehensive 
	and may not be able to correctly detect errors that are unaccounted for.

The code written in 'parser.py' is far from optimal, certain pieces maybe repeated, dictionaries could be
	used in the place of large if else statements, and etc. I am using this project as an opportunity
	to expand upon my very basic knowledge of Python and will work to improve the program's design
	as I learn more about how I should approach things in Python.
